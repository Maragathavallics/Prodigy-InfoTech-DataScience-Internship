# Data Science Internship
## Task 5: Traffic Accident Data Analysis
![Screenshot](Task5.png)
## Introduction

This project analyzes US traffic accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium, the analysis identifies accident hotspots, visualizes contributing factors, and highlights trends to better understand accident occurrences and their severity.
## Dataset

This project uses a sample dataset of US traffic accidents containing information such as accident severity, location, weather conditions, visibility, and road indicators. The data helps identify patterns and contributing factors to accidents across different states and cities.

## Task Description

Analyze US traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The project involves visualizing accident hotspots, examining contributing factors, and generating insights to better understand when and where accidents occur.
## Analysis Highlights

- Most accidents occur during evening hours (4–6 PM).
- "Clear" and "Rain" are the most common weather conditions during accidents.
- Cities like Los Angeles and Dallas have higher accident counts.
- Visibility tends to be lower in high-severity accidents.
- Many accidents happen near traffic signals.
## Key Findings

- Evening hours (especially 4–6 PM) see the highest number of accidents.
- Accidents are frequently associated with "Clear" and "Rain" weather conditions.
- Los Angeles and Dallas are among the cities with the most accidents.
- Reduced visibility often corresponds with higher accident severity.
- Traffic signals are present at many accident locations.
## Visualizations

- Histogram of accidents by hour of the day
- Count plots of weather and road conditions
- Top cities with most accidents
- Heatmap of accident hotspots
- Boxplots showing severity vs. visibility
## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the patterns and contributing factors of traffic accidents in the United States. By analyzing variables such as time of day, weather conditions, visibility, and road indicators, the study highlights areas and situations with higher accident risks. These findings can help inform safety measures, improve traffic management, and raise public awareness to reduce accident occurrences.
